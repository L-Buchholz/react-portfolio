# React-Portfolio

## Portfolio page

An employer/hiring manager has requested a React portfolio page that highlights and illustrates my coding experience. The following portfolio requisites ("Acceptance criteria") were requested and have now been implemented:

- The application consists of a single page containing a header (with navigation bar), content/portfolio section, and footer
- The navigation bar includes "About Me", "Portfolio", "Contact", and "Resume" sections
- Clicking on each nav bar link loads its respective section below the header
- The "Portfolio" section includes photos, titles, and links to at least six applications I have developed or contributed to
- _In development:_ The "Contact" section features an interactive form field with future back-end potential
- The "Resume" section highlights my coding proficiencies and links to a downloadable version of my resume
- The footer provides further sites where my work can be viewed and/or I can be contacted (including GitHub and LinkedIn)
- The page has a responsive layout for smaller screens

Additionally, all images have alt tags attributed to them for accessibility and the code includes comments.
